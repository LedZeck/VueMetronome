# VueMetronome

> A metronome built with Vue.js specially to Hacktoberfest 2017

## Current project specs

> * [x] Components global communication using Bus
> * [x] Find and add some cool `pop` or `click` .mp3 sound effects to our metronome
> * [x] Instantiate and use RythmJS
> * [x] Create a service that exactly calculates the .mp3 BPM.
> * [x] Create communication between buttons, slider and playbutton
> * [x] Fix metronome that was not playing as should
